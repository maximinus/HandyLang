Here is a **structured, realistic, and adaptable plan** to go from your **tokenizer** to a **working Python interpreter** for Handy, with clarity about milestones, deliverables, and flexibility for change as implementation progresses.

---

## ✅ **Step 0. Preparation**

✔ Ensure the **tokenizer is fully tested**, including:

* All keywords, operators, punctuation
* Strings with escapes
* Comments (line and block)
* Macro and runtime macro syntax (@)
* Example scripts exercising all tokens

Deliverable: **Tokenizer module with passing test suite**.

---

## ✅ **Step 1. Build a parser**

1. **Design the AST structure**

   * Define classes for key nodes: Program, Statement, Expression, Block, FunctionDef, IfStmt, ForStmt, MatchStmt, etc.

2. **Write a recursive descent parser**

   * Use your formal grammar as a roadmap.
   * Parse the token list to construct an AST.
   * Include basic error handling with informative messages (line/column if possible).

3. **Test with existing example scripts**

   * Confirm the AST is as expected.
   * Validate parse tree shapes in unit tests.

Deliverable: **Parser module producing AST nodes**.

---

## ✅ **Step 2. Implement the interpreter core**

1. **Design an Environment class**

   * Holds variables, constants, functions, types, and current scope.
   * Supports nested environments for functions, blocks, etc.

2. **Write evaluation methods for each AST node**

   * Program: evaluates top-level statements sequentially.
   * Variable declaration: updates environment.
   * Constants: assign as immutable values.
   * Expressions: evaluate recursively.
   * Function definitions: store as callable closures.
   * Function calls: resolve, create new environment, evaluate body.
   * Control flow (if, for, match): implement per language spec.
   * Code blocks: create new scoped environments.
   * Macros: parse but stub execution for now.

3. **Write an interpreter class or set of eval functions**

   * Takes the AST and an environment, executes it, returns results or modifies state.

Deliverable: **Interpreter module able to run simple Handy scripts** (var declarations, functions, prints, control flow).

---

## ✅ **Step 3. Implement functions and closures**

1. **Ensure functions are first-class**

   * Functions are objects with code, parameters, captured environment (closures).
   * Support calling with positional and named arguments.

2. **Add lambda/code block execution**

   * Support `{...}` assigned to variables and called later.
   * Support parameterised code blocks via `f(...) { ... }`.

Deliverable: **Function and lambda execution working, with unit tests for closures and scoping**.

---

## ✅ **Step 4. Implement macros and comptime**

1. **Macro system**

   * Parse macro definitions.
   * Implement macro expansion at parse or evaluation phase.
   * Handle backtick syntax for insertion of code fragments.

2. **Comptime evaluation**

   * Execute comptime functions at parse time, insert returned code into AST before interpretation.

Deliverable: **Basic macro and comptime support tested with example scripts**.

---

## ✅ **Step 5. Implement types and objects**

1. **Parse and store type definitions**

   * Classes with fields, methods, inheritance (single only).
   * Store in environment type registry.

2. **Support object creation and method calls**

   * `var x = TypeName(field=val)` syntax
   * `this` resolution inside methods

Deliverable: **Working type system with field access, methods, inheritance, and constructor calls**.

---

## ✅ **Step 6. Implement exceptions**

1. **Raise and catch exceptions**

   * `raise ExceptionType("message")`
   * `try { ... } except ExceptionType { ... }` syntax
   * Multiple except blocks and lists of exceptions

Deliverable: **Exception handling with meaningful test cases**.

---

## ✅ **Step 7. Implement tests and assertions**

1. **Parse test blocks**

   * Ignore during normal runs
   * Evaluate only when in testing mode

2. **Implement assertion functions**

   * assertEqual, assertNotEqual, assertTrue, assertFalse, assertRaises

Deliverable: **Running inline tests with pass/fail outputs**.

---

## ✅ **Step 8. Build REPL and image persistence**

1. **Simple REPL**

   * Input a line, tokenize, parse, evaluate, print result or error.
   * Maintain persistent environment state.

2. **Image saving/loading**

   * Serialize environment (variables, functions, types) to disk
   * Load and restore to resume session

Deliverable: **REPL and image system for live coding experiments**.

---

## ✅ **Step 9. Robustness and integration tests**

1. **Write comprehensive tests**

   * Unit tests for parser, interpreter functions, environment management
   * Integration tests for end-to-end script execution
   * Edge case tests: invalid syntax, invalid types, runtime errors

2. **Document limitations and known issues**

---

## ✅ **Step 10. Prepare for C implementation**

1. **Document interpreter architecture clearly**

   * AST structure, evaluation semantics, environment model, function call flow

2. **Identify performance-critical parts**

   * Functions, loops, heavy numeric operations

3. **Design C ABI interface for external libraries**

   * Type conversions, calling conventions, error propagation

Deliverable: **Technical design doc to guide C reimplementation or LLVM backend**.

---

## ### ✨ **Key mindset**

✔ **Iterate incrementally.** Each step produces working code to test and build confidence.
✔ **Be open to plan changes** as design flaws or better approaches emerge.
✔ **Prioritise clarity and correctness** over performance in the reference interpreter.
✔ **Write tests at each stage** to validate progress and catch regressions.

Let me know when ready to start **Step 1 parser design**, and I will draft:

* An **AST class layout** for your first parser implementation
* A simple **parser skeleton** for rapid development tomorrow.
